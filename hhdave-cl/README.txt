Common Lisp implementation of Euler problem 54

The only external dependency (apart from a Common Lisp implementation)
is cl-ppcre. This can be installed via quicklisp

If I get chance I will try and remove that dependency. 

I've tried to keep it fairly concise, but hopefully without
sacrificing readability.
